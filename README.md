# Landing Page

A sample project that builds a multi-section landing page with dynamically updating the navigational menu
based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

The project consists of 3 main files.
* index.html: contains most of the html elements.
* styles.css: element styling sheet.
* app.js: contains functions for manipulating the DOM.

## Run

Simply open index.html file on your browser.

## Eslint

I use Eslint to make code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

## Install Eslint
```
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

## Run Eslint after checking .eslintrc.js
```
npx eslint yourfile.js
```
